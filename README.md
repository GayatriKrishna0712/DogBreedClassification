# <u>Dog Breed Classification</u>
In this project we will use keras and tensorflow to build, train and test a CNN capable of identifying the breed of a dog in a supplied image. 
It is a supervised learning problem, specifically a multiclass classification problem.


#<u>Plan of Attack</u>
1. loading the data from kaagle
2. load labels csv for labels that contain image ID and breed
3. checking the breed count
4. one hot encoding on labels data prediction column
5. load the images, convert them to an array and normalize them
6. checked the shape and size of the X and Y data
7. building the model network architechture
8. split the data and fit it into the model and create an accuracy plot
9. evaluate the model for accuracy score
10. using the model for prediction
